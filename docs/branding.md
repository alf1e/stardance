# Stardance branding

Authoritative reference for the Stardance visual identity: colors, typography,
containers, buttons, and forms. Sourced from the Figma "design system" page in

Read this doc when you need details beyond the brief — anything to do with
typography sizing, button states, container semantics, or which set/accent
applies in a given context.

## 1. Colors

The palette is split into four families:

| Family | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Sets 1–4** | Surfaces: page background + container fills, paired with their own foreground text colors. |
| **Highlights** | Quiet attention-grabbers (callouts, toasts, badges) that aren't a full accent. |
| **Accents 1–6** | The expressive pastel palette — used sparingly for emphasis, illustrations, status, branded surfaces. |
| **Foreground** | Pure white text used on dark sets. |

**Rule:** never use pure black `#000000`. The darkest color in the system is
set 1's background, `#08061E`.

**Rule:** when in doubt, pick from the palette below. If you must go outside it,
stay pastel — avoid deep saturated colors that fight with the rest of the
system.

### 1.1 Sets (containers + their text)

Each set is a `(background, secondary-foreground)` pair. The "foreground" is
always `#FFFFFF` (white). Use `secondary-foreground` for muted/secondary text
on top of that set's `background`.

| Set | Background | Secondary foreground | Where to use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Set 1** — main | `#08061E` | `#83828D` | Page background. Containers with lots of text: posts, notifications, comments. Default surface. |
| **Set 2** — dark blue | `#343651` | `#83828D` | Cards that are themselves interactive: project cards, clickable cards. |
| **Set 3** — solid blue | `#606684` | `#AFB2C1` | Profile sections, top-of-page cards. The "lifted" surface. |
| **Set 4** — highlighted | `#66625C` | `#B3B1AD` | Highlighted posts/cards that need to draw attention (e.g. featured "latest ship"). Numerically the canonical highlight cream (`#FEFCE7`) at ~40% alpha over set 1 — warm-gray that pairs with a cream highlight border. |

Foreground text on any set: `#FFFFFF`.

### 1.2 Highlights

For badges, callouts, toast strips, light-on-dark emphasis — not full accents,
not container surfaces. They live on top of set 1 / set 2.

| Token | Hex | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Highlight** | `#F4EBB9` | Soft golden yellow. |
| **Secondary highlight** | `#FEFCE7` | Near-white cream — used as a quieter alternative to `Highlight`. |

#### Extra highlight — the four-corner gradient

A mesh blend of four brand accents (yellow → salmon along the top, lilac →
brand-blue along the bottom). Sourced from the Figma "extra highlight"
sample. CSS radial-gradients can't reproduce the mesh faithfully, so the
canonical asset is a PNG shipped at
[`app/assets/images/gradients/extra-highlight.png`](../app/assets/images/gradients/extra-highlight.png)
and exposed as the CSS token `--gradient-extra-highlight`.

**Rule of thumb: at most one or two on a page.** This is the loudest surface
the system offers — reserve it for moments that deserve genuine spectacle
(a Super-Star Project chip, a hero badge, a once-per-page celebration). On
every other surface, use the regular accents or highlights.

**Usage.** The token resolves to a `url(...)`, so the consumer is responsible
for the sizing keywords. Always set it via the background shorthand so the
asset covers the element and is centred:

```scss
background: var(--gradient-extra-highlight) center / cover no-repeat;
color:      var(--color-set-1-bg); // dark ink on a bright pastel
```

Example uses today:
- `.project-show__badge--fire` (Super-Star Project chip)

### 1.3 Accents

Six pastels, used for branded surfaces, illustrations, status colors, and any
"colored area" decision. Reach for these before inventing new HSL tints.

| Token | Hex | Common role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Accent 1** — peach | `#FFD598` | Warm, gentle emphasis. |
| **Accent 2** — yellow | `#FFE564` | Stars, special-action button fill, "important". |
| **Accent 3** — salmon | `#FF8D9D` | Warn / destructive accents. |
| **Accent 4** — blue | `#95DBFF` | Cool emphasis. |
| **Accent 5** — lilac | `#EBB7FF` | Default primary accent. |
| **Accent 6** — mint | `#81FFFF` | Cool emphasis, "online"/"active" states. |

### 1.4 Special cases

When a surface needs to disappear into another set's background (e.g. a card
embedded inside a set 1 area that shouldn't visually separate), use the same
hex as the surrounding background — set 1, set 2, or set 3 background — rather
than going transparent or inventing a new color.

### 1.5 Mapping to CSS variables

These tokens already exist in
[_variables.scss](../app/assets/stylesheets/config/_variables.scss). When you
write SCSS, reference the variable, not the hex.

| Doc token | CSS variable | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Set 1 background `#08061E` | `--color-space-bg` | Currently defined as `hsl(245, 55%, 8%)` — approximately the same but not pixel-exact. Prefer using the variable; if a pixel-exact match is needed, use the hex directly. |
| Accent 1 peach `#FFD598` | `--color-brand-peach` | ✓ exact |
| Accent 2 yellow `#FFE564` | `--color-brand-yellow` | ✓ exact |
| Accent 3 salmon `#FF8D9D` | `--color-brand-salmon` | ✓ exact |
| Accent 4 blue `#95DBFF` | `--color-brand-blue` | ✓ exact |
| Accent 5 lilac `#EBB7FF` | `--color-brand-lilac` | ✓ exact |
| Accent 6 mint `#81FFFF` | `--color-brand-mint` | ✓ exact |
| Highlight `#F4EBB9` | `--color-brand-highlight` | ✓ exact (also `--color-brand-highlight-soft` α 0.4 and `-faint` α 0.12 for tinted variants) |
| Secondary highlight `#FEFCE7` | `--color-brand-highlight-secondary` | ✓ exact |
| Extra-highlight gradient | `--gradient-extra-highlight` | Four-stop radial blend — yellow / salmon / lilac / blue. Set as the value of `background:` (not `background-color`). |
| Set 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 backgrounds | `--color-set-1-bg` … `--color-set-4-bg` | ✓ exact |
| Set 4 hex | `--color-set-4-bg: #66625C` | The original audit listed `#65625D` — refined to `#66625C` (cream `#FEFCE7` at 40% alpha over set 1). |
| Set N secondary foregrounds | _(no variables yet)_ | Add `--color-set-N-fg-secondary` when first needed. |

## 2. Typography

Two type families:

- **Exo 2** — the workhorse. All body, headings, labels.
- **Playfair Display** — italic emphasis variant for **Title** and **Title 2**.
  Used to add a touch of editorial weight to the largest type. Always bold
  italic.

### 2.1 Scale

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Casing | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Title** | Exo 2 _or_ Playfair Display _bold italic_ | 70px | Bold | normal | Hero-level page titles (one per page max). The Playfair variant is the editorial flourish; Exo 2 is the plain variant. Pick one per title. |
| **Title 2** | Exo 2 _or_ Playfair Display _bold italic_ | 56px | Bold | normal | Secondary page titles, large section titles, modal titles. Same Exo/Playfair pairing as Title. |
| **Heading** | Exo 2 | 40px | Bold | normal | Section headings inside a page. |
| **Small heading** | Exo 2 | 22px | Bold | **ALL CAPS** | Subsection / group labels above lists or cards. The all-caps cue distinguishes it from Body at the same size. |
| **Body** | Exo 2 | 22px | Regular | normal | Default page text. |
| **Label** | Exo 2 | 16px | Regular | normal | Form labels, captions, metadata, fine print. |

### 2.2 Notes

- **Italics for emphasis at title sizes only.** Playfair Display is bold-italic
  for Title / Title 2 — don't introduce Playfair at smaller sizes, and don't
  italicize Exo 2 as a substitute. The italic moment is reserved.
- **Playfair fallback.** If Playfair Display isn't loaded in a given context,
  fall back through `"Times New Roman", Georgia, serif` so the italic feel
  survives (this is already the pattern in `_hero.scss` and the sidebar's
  active-nav label).
- **Exo 2 fallback.** `"Exo 2", sans-serif` — the system default sans is fine
  if Exo 2 is missing.
- **Line height.** `--line-height-headers: 1.1` for headings, `normal` for
  body. Defined in `_variables.scss`.
- **Mobile.** Body shrinks to 16px below 600px viewport width. See the
  `@media (max-width: 600px)` block in `_variables.scss`. The landing scale
  (`--font-display`, `--font-h2`, `--font-h3`, `--font-body`, `--font-subtitle`)
  is fluid-clamped — use those tokens on landing pages instead of the fixed
  scale above.

## 3. Containers

All containers use an **8px corner radius**. Four standard "set" variants plus
one special case.

| Variant | Border | Background | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Main container** (set 1) | 2px | `#08061E` | Posts, notifications, comments — anywhere with a lot of text. Default container. |
| **Dark blue container** (set 2) | 2px | `#343651` | Project cards and other clickable cards. The presence of a border signals "you can click me." |
| **Solid blue container** (set 3) | _none_ | `#606684` | Profile sections, top-of-page cards. No border because they sit above the page surface visually. |
| **Highlighted container** (set 4) | 2px | `#66625C` | Highlighted posts/cards that need to stand out — warmer tone than the blues. Pairs naturally with a `--color-brand-highlight` border. |

**Borders.** When a set has a 2px border, the border color matches the
container's secondary-foreground (the muted text color) — this gives the edge
the same "muted" feel as the supporting text inside.

**Special case — invisible container.** When a container shouldn't visually
separate from its parent surface, set its background to the same hex as the
surface it's sitting on (set 1, 2, or 3). Don't use `transparent` — pick the
matching hex explicitly so the container still renders predictably when
copy-pasted or moved.

---

## 4. Buttons

Three button types: **small action**, **large action**, **special action**.
Each has variants and states. All three use **fully rounded corners** (pill
shape — `border-radius` = half the height).

### 4.0 Background-aware variants

The Figma defines **two visual variants** of every button, picked based on
the surface the button sits on:

| Variant | Use on which sets | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dark-bg variant** | Set 1 (`#08061E`) and set 2 (`#343651`) | Primary fills lean cream/highlight to pop against the dark surface. |
| **Light-bg variant** | Set 3 (`#606684`) and set 4 (`#66625C`) | Primary fills lean white because the cream highlight blends into set 3/4. |

Reach for the variant that matches the **immediate parent surface**, not the
page background. A pill inside a set-3 panel uses the light-bg variant, even
though the page itself is set 1.

The state matrix below lists the **dark-bg** variant — the one used for the
top-level action row on most pages. The light-bg variant follows the same
pattern but pushes Normal one step lighter (`brand-highlight` →
`brand-highlight-secondary` or `white`).

### 4.1 Small action buttons

- **Text:** 16px, bold.
- **Border:** 2px.
- **Padding:** 16px horizontal, 3px vertical.
- **Used for:** Edit profile / Edit post, Save and discard on profile / posts,
  confirmation popups, follow / unfollow.
- **Hover behaviour:** at this size the button doesn't have an end icon, so
  hover just shifts the fill (no symbol movement).

**Variants & states (dark-bg):**

| | Normal | Hover | Pressed | Disabled |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary action** — *filled* | `--color-brand-highlight` (`#F4EBB9`) fill, `--color-set-1-bg` text, no border | `--color-brand-highlight-secondary` (`#FEFCE7`) fill | white fill | `opacity: 0.5` over normal |
| **Secondary action** — *outlined* | `--color-set-2-bg` fill, white text, white 2px border | same fill, icon transition | same fill, `--color-brand-highlight` text + `--color-brand-highlight` border | `opacity: 0.5` over normal |
| **Destructive action** | transparent fill, `--color-brand-salmon` text, `--color-brand-salmon` 2px border | `--color-brand-salmon` fill, `--color-set-1-bg` text | `--color-brand-salmon` fill, dark text (slightly washed) | `opacity: 0.5` over normal |

**Light-bg overrides** (when used inside a set-3 or set-4 surface):

- **Primary** — full state ladder reverses on a light bg, stepping
  *darker* with each interaction so pressing reads as "more filled":
  - **Normal:** white fill (`--color-space-text`)
  - **Hover:** `--color-brand-highlight-secondary` (`#FEFCE7`)
  - **Pressed:** `--color-brand-highlight` (`#F4EBB9`)
  - **Disabled:** opacity 0.5
- **Secondary normal** swaps the set-2 fill → **transparent** so the
  surrounding surface shows through; border stays white-on-set-3 or
  dark-text-on-set-4.
- Destructive variant unchanged.

### 4.2 Large action buttons

- **Text:** 22px, bold.
- **Border:** 2px.
- **Padding:** ≥32px horizontal _or_ fill the row horizontally; 12px vertical.
- **End icon:** optional. When present, **the icon translates right on
  hover** (the button body itself doesn't move).
- **Used for:** the primary action on a page or modal — "Post a devlog",
  "Create new ship", external link buttons like "Try project" / "See source
  code".

**Variants & states (dark-bg):**

| | Normal | Hover | Pressed | Disabled |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary action** — *filled* | `--color-brand-highlight` (`#F4EBB9`) fill, dark text, no border (border-color matches fill) | `--color-brand-highlight-secondary` (`#FEFCE7`) fill | white fill | `opacity: 0.5` over normal |
| **Secondary action** — *outlined* | `--color-set-2-bg` fill, white text, white 2px border | same fill, end-icon translates right | same fill, `--color-brand-highlight` text + border | `opacity: 0.5` over normal |

**Light-bg overrides:**

- **Primary** — same darker-on-press ladder as the small-action variant:
  white normal → `--color-brand-highlight-secondary` hover →
  `--color-brand-highlight` pressed.
- **Secondary normal** keeps the white border + white text but drops the fill
  to transparent.

### 4.3 Special action button

- **Shape:** the button body sits inside a **star symbol** outline — the
  rounded-rect button overlaps a star shape so a few of the star's points peek
  out behind the pill. The star and the pill share the same fill colour at
  every state.
- **Text:** 22px, bold.
- **Border:** the pill itself has a 2px transparent border (so the star fill
  shows through underneath); the star isn't bordered, it's filled.
- **Padding:** ≥32px horizontal, 12px vertical.
- **End icon:** required (an arrow / arrow-like glyph). On hover, the icon
  translates right *and* the star rotates 72° clockwise.
- **Used for:** big, important, and (ish-)irreversible actions. New post,
  submitting a rating, "Continue" in forms. The star is the cue that this
  button is the climactic action of a flow — don't sprinkle it on minor
  buttons.

**State matrix** (dark bg only — special action isn't shown on light surfaces):

| | Normal | Hover | Pressed | Disabled |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Star + pill fill | `--color-brand-highlight` | `--color-brand-highlight` (star rotates 72° CW, end-icon shifts right) | white fill | `opacity: 0.5` over normal |
| Text | dark (`--color-set-1-bg`) | same | same | `opacity: 0.5` |

**States:**

- **Normal** — star + pill at rest.
- **Hover** — **star rotates 72° clockwise** (= one fifth of a turn — one
  point of the star) and the end icon translates right.
- **Pressed** — star locks at the hover position; subtle compression.
- **Disabled** — 50% opacity.

### 4.4 Approved button backgrounds

Each button group is designed against specific set backgrounds. The Figma
labels the approved background swatches under each group as "For these
backgrounds/containers". The short version: assume **small buttons** and
**large secondary buttons** are tuned for **set 1 / set 2**. The **large
primary** (yellow) and **special action** stay legible on any set because
their fill is bright. If you put a small button on set 3 or set 4, retest
contrast.

---

## 5. Forms and inputs

The Figma is sparse here — only one field type is shown.

### 5.1 Field pattern

- **Layout:** label on the left, input on the right (horizontal pair).
- **Label:** Label type token (Exo 2 16px regular).
- **Help icon:** a small `?` circle sits immediately after the label when the
  field has a tooltip / hint. Hover or focus reveals the hint.
- **Input:** rounded-corner box, set against set 1 background, with a thin
  muted border. Inherits its border color from the surrounding set's
  secondary-foreground.

When in doubt about a form pattern that isn't in the Figma yet (radio groups,
selects, multi-line text), pick the pattern that's most consistent with this
one — labels on the left, inputs filling the remaining row width, set-1 fills,
muted borders — and document the choice back into this section.

---

## 6. Spacing and radii

- **Container radius:** 8px (everywhere except buttons).
- **Button radius:** fully rounded (= half the button's height).
- **Border weight:** 2px when a border is present.
- **Spacing tokens:** use `--space-*` from `_variables.scss`
  (`--space-xxxs` 4px → `--space-xxxxl` 64px). The button paddings above
  (`16px`, `32px`, `12px`, `3px`) don't all map cleanly to the scale — they're
  baked into the button component styles rather than picked freshly per usage.

---

## 7. House rules (TL;DR for fast lookups)

1. Never use pure black. Use set 1 background `#08061E`.
2. Pick colors from the palette. If you need a new color, stay pastel.
3. Page background defaults to set 1 (`#08061E`). Reach for sets 2–4 for
   containers within the page.
4. Body text: white (`#FFFFFF`). Muted text: the secondary-foreground of the
   set you're sitting on.
5. Exo 2 everywhere; Playfair Display bold-italic only for Title / Title 2 as
   editorial emphasis.
6. Containers: 8px radius. Buttons: fully rounded.
7. **Primary action buttons fill with `--color-brand-highlight` (`#F4EBB9`),
   not yellow.** Yellow `#FFE564` is *only* used inside the
   `--gradient-extra-highlight` mesh (see §1.2) — it doesn't appear as a
   solid fill anywhere else.
8. Salmon `#FF8D9D` signals warn/destructive. Use it for that, not decoration.
9. Disabled = 50% opacity over the normal state — don't invent a separate
   disabled color.
10. CSS lives in `app/assets/stylesheets/`, all selectors follow BEM
    (`block / block__element / block--modifier`). Reference design tokens via
    `var(--token-name)`, not inline hex.
